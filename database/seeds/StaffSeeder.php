He has had the opportunity to speak all over the world and has impacted tens of thousands of lives.<\/p><p>Pastor Chris has written a biographical look at his life and the transformation that took place. The book is called The Climb of Your Life. Chris said if his life could transition from the project to the pulpit; from a life of devastation to an amazing destiny, then so can any life.<\/p><p>As the Senior Pastor of Faith Promise Church, he has seen thousands find hope and fulfillment in their destiny. Chris says his purpose is to help people recognize and achieve their full potential. He came so close to death and missing all God had for him he now wants to help others find the same purpose in their lives that he has found.<\/p><p>Pastor's blog and information about his book can be found at <a href=\"http:\/\/drchrisstephens.com\">DrChrisStephens.com<\/a>.<\/p><p>You can also connect with Pastor Chris via <a href=\"http:\/\/facebook.com\/pastorchris\">Facebook<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drchrisstephens\">Twitter<\/a>.<\/p>",

I began my relationship with Jesus at the age of 8 years old, and what a ride it has been!<\/p><p><strong>My Calling:<\/strong> As far as a calling to be a worship leader ? that one kind of snuck up on me. I had grown up in a musical home where both of my parents lead in worship through singing and playing the guitar. My dad would make me play the piano and sing (at the time I hated it ? I was scared to death!) in church, during mission trips, or anywhere else he could find. After all those experiences, I guess I should have seen what was coming down the pike.<\/p><p>I met my sweetheart at what was then called the BSU at UT-Chattanooga. He was going to be a preacher ? me a preacher?s wife?! But now I know that God had prepared me my whole life to be Chris? helpmate and ministry partner. I loved working in different areas as we began our ministry, but it seemed no matter what ministry it was, worship was at the heart.<\/p><p>As the ministry assistant to the Worship Pastor at Faith Promise Church, they asked me to fill in when he left until they could find someone. Well, that was almost 9 years ago. God has confirmed to me over and over that He called me and put me where I am today ? I would have never believed it, and there is no way I could do what I do without the anointing and favor of the Lord.<\/p><p><strong>Favorite Music:<\/strong> Anything Hillsong, anything Chris Tomlin, and ?clean? classic rock.

I have been a member of Faith Promise Church since its inception in 1995. I have always enjoyed serving here - so when the opportunity arose to serve here full-time I took it! I have been on staff at Faith Promise since 2001 as an intern in the Worship Ministry and have served on full-time staff since 2003. Since then I've had the unique privilege of ministering to thousands of my brothers and sisters each week through my gift of music. I attended Oak Ridge High School in Oak Ridge, TN and graduated there in 1999. I attended the University of Tennessee after that and graduated in 2003 with an honors degree in mathematics. I have been married to my beautiful wife Kara since October 2006.<\/p><p><strong>FAVES:<\/strong><br>I love to read, watch and play sports, and make music. I enjoy spending time with my wife and with friends. As far as music goes, I love it all...you'll find me listening to anything from Coltrane to Coldplay, Sigur Ros to Sergei Rachmaninoff, U2 to the David Crowder Band and Hillsong. I'm always into something different. I love to read as well and I love exploring the Bible through fresh sets of eyes. Some of my favorite books include Velvet Elvis by Rob Bell, Blue Like Jazz by Donald Miller, and A Generous Orthodoxy by Brian McLaren. Check them out! I'm also a HUGE fan of the Green Bay Packers, the Boston Red Sox, NASCAR, and University of Tennessee athletics. Go VOLS!<\/p><p>God bless you!<br>Hebrews 12:1-3<\/p>",

I was home schooled for all twelve years of my primary education, and after high school I went to Johnson Bible College (now Johnson University).<\/p><p>I graduated in 2013 with a Bachelors of Science in Biblical Studies and Digital Video Production. I have always had a love for storytelling, and video is the primary way we communicate stories in this day in age. I have loved films and filmmaking for some time.<\/p><p>In college I spent two summers in Seattle, WA, and it quickly became a second home for me. In my senior year of college, I had the privilege to be a Director of Photography for a small Christian feature film made in the Knoxville area. I have also participated in several competitions for the Knoxville film festival.<\/p><p>Through some of my internships in college, I became the Student Pastor at Life Point Church. In September of 2013, Life Point became a Faith Promise Campus, and I stayed on in my role of Student Pastor.<\/p>",
