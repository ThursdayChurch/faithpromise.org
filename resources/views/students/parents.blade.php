    <p>fpStudents realizes that we are not the answer to discipling studentsâ€¦parents are! We are excited to get to partner with parents in ministering to their students, even in the midst of changing dynamics in their relationship with their students. The following is a list of resources that we encourage you as a parent to utilize to continue connecting with your student and help them grow in their faith.</p>
